## Executive Summary (â‰¤150 words)
We expect 4.5 million euros from a European client in one year. Changes in the EUR/USD rate could affect how much we receive in dollars. To manage this risk, we are considering three options, forward contracts, currency options, or a money market hedge. The goal is to protect against losses while keeping some potential upside if the euro strengthens. We will build a simple model to compare these options and decide the best approach.

## Background & Objectives
Right now, our euro receivable exposes us to exchange rate risk. If the euro weakens, the USD we receive will be lower than expected, which could impact revenue and planning. Our main goal is to protect the company from losses due to volatile. Another goal is to consider options that still allow some upside if the euro strengthens.

## Methods
Forward Contract: Lock in a known rate today for the euro payment next year.

Currency Options: Buy a put to guarantee a minimum USD amount; optionally sell a call to reduce cost.

Money Market Hedge: Borrow USD now, convert to euros, and invest to match the payment timing.

We will create a simple Excel model using the receivable amount, current spot and forward rates, interest rates, and option premiums. The model will calculate expected USD proceeds under different FX scenarios.

## Limitations & Next Steps
Limitations: FX rates and interest rates are unpredictable, and hedging costs could change. Our model relies on assumptions that may not cover extreme market moves.
Next Steps: Build the Excel model (Stage 2) to compare outcomes for each hedge. Then analyze results (Stage 3) to pick the approach that balances risk, cost, and flexibility
