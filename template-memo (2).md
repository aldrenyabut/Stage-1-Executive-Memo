## Executive Summary (â‰¤150 words)
Our firm will receive 1,000,000 euros on October 27, 2025. Exchange rate fluctuations could reduce the USD value of this payment. We looked at three FX hedging strategies, forward contracts, futures, and options, using a spreadsheet model that includes USD proceeds and sensitivity to +/-5% EUR/USD changes. The forward contract provides predictable USD proceeds, is simple to implement, and requires no upfront cost, making it the recommended hedge to protect cash flow.

## Background & Objectives
Receiving a large payment in euros exposes us to FX risk. A weaker euro could reduce the USD amount we receive. Our main goal is to protect expected cash flows, minimize risk, and make the process simple and cost-effective.

## Methods
We built a spreadsheet model with:
Inputs: 1,000,000 euros, payment date, spot rate, forward/futures rates, options.
Calculations: USD proceeds for unhedged, forward, futures, and option scenarios.
Sensitivity: +/-5% FX rate changes.
Outputs: Comparison table and charts showing USD outcomes for each hedge.

## Limitations & Next Steps
Limitations: Forward/futures locks prevent benefiting from a stronger euro and options cost a premium and are more complex.
Next Steps: Execute a forward contract for the October 27 payment, update the model with current rates, and monitor FX conditions to adjust if necessary.
